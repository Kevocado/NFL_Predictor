"""Null the ATS / totals hit flags an older build fabricated.

This is a data migration, not a bug fix
---------------------------------------
An older build of `tracking/store.py::_compute_hits` graded the spread and totals
markets from whatever it happened to have:

    if home_spread_line is not None and pd.notna(home_spread_line):
        predicted_home_cover = (home_cover_prob or 0) >= (away_cover_prob or 0)

The probabilities were never checked. A game snapshotted with a spread line but no
cover probabilities -- exactly what the odds feed yields when it has a spread without a
matching market -- was recorded as a graded call the model never made: `(None or 0)`
against `(None or 0)` is `0.0 >= 0.0`, and `>=` resolves that to the home side. So it
fabricated a HIT when the home team covered and a MISS when the home team did not, and
persisted both to the track record.

Both ends of that are fixed and merged. `_compute_hits` now requires presence through
`_present` and leaves the flag NULL; `_summarize_games` excludes such rows from the
aggregate; `get_game_verdict` declines to report the market. What none of them can reach
is the data those fixes could not reach -- rows already written to a deployed
`tracking.db` still carry the fabricated flags. This script nulls them and nothing
else. It does not touch the write path, the read path, the probabilities, the lines,
the scores, or `moneyline_hit`, and it never deletes a row.

The predicate
-------------
A row is fabricated when a hit flag is set but the probabilities the grade claims to
compare are missing:

    (ats_hit   IS NOT NULL AND (home_cover_prob IS NULL OR away_cover_prob IS NULL))
 OR (total_hit IS NOT NULL AND (over_prob     IS NULL OR under_prob     IS NULL))

`OR` within a market, not "both are NULL": the old expression also fabricated a grade
out of a *half* market -- `0.6` against `None` reads as the home side -- and a row
graded from half a market is exactly as unusable as one graded from none.

Why this cannot catch a legitimately graded row
------------------------------------------------
The predicate is not a heuristic keyed on a suspicious value. It is a contradiction
between two fields of the same row, and the write path makes it unsatisfiable:

  * `_compute_hits` writes a non-NULL `ats_hit` if and only if
    `_present(home_spread_line) and _present(home_cover_prob, away_cover_prob)`.
    `_present` is `all(v is not None and not pd.isna(v))`, so a row the current write
    path graded carries *both* cover probabilities.
  * The predicate requires at least one of them to be NULL.

A row cannot satisfy both, so the predicate is empty over the output of the current
write path. The same argument holds for totals. Two things follow that are worth
stating rather than leaving implicit:

  * **0.0 is not NULL.** A confident zero is a legible probability, not a missing one --
    that is the entire reason the original bug was possible -- so a genuine grade built
    on `home_cover_prob = 0.0, away_cover_prob = 1.0` is preserved. This is the
    distinction a `COALESCE(home_cover_prob, 0) = 0` style predicate would erase, and
    `tests/test_null_fabricated_market_hits.py` pins it with a grid that pushes every
    structural case through both `_compute_hits` and this SQL and asserts the two never
    disagree about a row.
  * **The argument is conditional on `_compute_hits` being the only writer of these two
    columns.** Verified by grep over `src/`, `scripts/` and the frontend: it is. It is
    deliberately *not* conditional on the row also having a spread line, even though
    every row the old build fabricated necessarily had one (its guard was on the line).
    Requiring the line would narrow the predicate on the strength of an assumption about
    provenance rather than about the defect, and would silently leave rows behind if
    that assumption were ever wrong. The survey reports how many matched rows have no
    line so an operator can see it if it happens.

What this cannot know
---------------------
  * **Whether a stored grade that agrees with its probabilities is correct.** This
    verifies the shape of the row, not the truth of the call. A well-formed but wrong
    grade from some other cause is untouched, and nothing here would find it.
  * **What the grade would have been.** The probabilities were never computed, so there
    is nothing to recompute from. The row cannot be recovered, only retired.
  * **Which build wrote a matched row.** The signature identifies the defect, not the
    process. It cannot distinguish "written by the build we know about" from "written by
    something else with the same blind spot".
  * **Anything about rows it does not match.** Fabricating a grade from a *present* but
    nonsensical probability pair, for instance, leaves no signature this can see.

Usage
-----
    python scripts/null_fabricated_market_hits.py                    # dry run on the app db
    python scripts/null_fabricated_market_hits.py --db /path/db      # dry run, explicit
    python scripts/null_fabricated_market_hits.py --db /path/db --execute
    python scripts/null_fabricated_market_hits.py --db /path/db --verify-only

`--execute` is the only thing that writes. The default run opens the database with
SQLite's `mode=ro`, so it cannot create a file either -- a survey pointed at the wrong
path is an error, not an empty `tracking.db` left behind. `--verify-only` re-opens
read-only and exits nonzero if any fabricated row remains, which is the check to run
afterwards to prove the migration did what it said.

`--execute` copies the database to `<db>.bak-<utc timestamp>` first, through SQLite's
online backup API rather than a file copy, because the live database runs in WAL mode
and a plain `shutil.copy` can miss committed pages still sitting in the `-wal` sidecar.
