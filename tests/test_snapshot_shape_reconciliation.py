"""A reused week must not be able to silently miss a newly added field.

`build_snapshot()` copies weeks outside the rebuild window verbatim. That is the
right call for cost and the wrong call for shape: a copied week cannot pick up a
field the code has started emitting, so a new field reaches the artifact on the
few weeks that happen to be in the window and nowhere else.

This is not hypothetical. `is_starter` and `depth_slot` were added to the prop
rows while every week carrying props sat outside the window, so the fields
reached nothing. The failure looks like a serialization bug and is not.
