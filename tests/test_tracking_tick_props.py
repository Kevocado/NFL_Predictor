"""Props must be stored against the game they describe.

`background_tracking_tick` maps a prop to a game with `team_to_game`, then
writes the pair with `INSERT OR IGNORE` — and those rows are immutable, so the
first write is the snapshot forever. If the map and the props disagree about
which week they are talking about, a wrong pair is written once and can never be
corrected.

**This file's premise changed, and the correction matters.** When it was first
written, the tick's `games` was `fetch_upcoming_games(season, week)` — one week.
The report that prompted it ("`team_to_game` is now built from this week AND
next week's games") was therefore true of neither repo *at that commit*, and
saying so was correct.

The Kalshi feed (PR #3) then made the report's first clause true:
`_games_to_snapshot` fetches `(week, week + 1)` and concatenates, because
`current_season_and_week()` rolls over on week 1's first kickoff rather than on
a fixed week boundary. So today the map really is built from two weeks of games,
and a team in both weeks is genuinely ambiguous.

What stops it is one line — `for _, g in games[games["week"] == week]` — so that
filter is the load-bearing thing, and it is what these tests pin. The first
version of this file asserted the single-week fetch instead, which was true then
and stopped being true without anyone noticing: the test was shaped like the
consumer, not like the producer.

The end-to-end test at the bottom is the one that matters, and its prop belongs
to the team that plays in BOTH weeks. A prop for a team that appears once lands
on the right game whether or not the filter exists, so it cannot tell the two
cases apart — which is exactly how the first version of it proved nothing.
