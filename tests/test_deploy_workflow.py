"""A merge to main must deploy to the VPS, and nothing else should.

The deploy workflow existed only for Azure, was `workflow_dispatch`-only, and
had no VPS job at all, so a merge deployed nothing: every deploy was a manual
image build plus a hand-run `bin/deploy`. This pins the replacement, because
the failure mode it guards is silent — a workflow that does not run looks
exactly like a workflow with nothing to deploy.

Two things here are not obvious and are the reason the test exists:

* **The paths filter is a whitelist**, so excluding the files the scheduled
  snapshot jobs commit is implicit. That means nothing stops someone adding
  `data/**` and putting every scheduled refresh into a deploy loop. The
  exclusion is asserted directly instead of trusted to the filter's shape.

* **Azure is gated with `== 'true'`, not `!= 'false'`.** The uncommitted local
  edit in the sibling checkouts used the failing-open form, which turns Azure
  back on for any repo that has not explicitly set the variable. This is
  legacy infrastructure being cut over, so it has to fail closed.

Every check below is also run against a deliberately broken copy of the file
to prove it can fail. A workflow guard that passes vacuously is worse than no
guard, because it is trusted.
