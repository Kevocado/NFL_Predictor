"""Task 1: the store's feed columns, feed reader and calibration reader.

Adapted from the plan, which added a `backfilled` INTEGER column and a one-time legacy
classification. PR #1 already merged a better version of that idea: `_snapshotted_after_kickoff`,
i.e. `snapshotted_at >= commence_time`, computed live from two columns that always existed, and
failing CLOSED (an unparseable row counts as not-pre-game). So this task:

- adds the five distribution columns (that part is still a schema change), and
- derives "pre-game" from the existing predicate instead of storing a flag, which cannot go stale
  and needs no migration pass over legacy rows.

`/api/track-record` already reports `n_rebuilt` from that same predicate, so the plan's
`n_backfilled` is not added -- it would be the same number under a second name.
