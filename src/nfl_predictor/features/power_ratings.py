"""power_ratings.py — Elo-style team power ratings, margin-of-victory
weighted.

Standard NFL Elo shape (à la 538's NFL model): expected score from a
logistic function of the rating gap plus a home-field bonus, update scaled
by both the surprise (actual - expected) and a margin-of-victory
multiplier so a 40-point win moves ratings more than a 3-point win.
Chronological — every game's *pregame* rating only reflects games played
strictly before it, so this is safe to use as a training feature with no
lookahead.
