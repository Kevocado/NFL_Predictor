"""rolling_form.py — each team's own rolling scoring form, no lookahead.

Reshapes games into one row per team-appearance (home and away rows each
carry "points_scored"/"points_allowed" from that team's own perspective),
computes a shift(1) rolling mean per team so the current game is always
excluded, then reshapes back — same shift(1)-then-reshape discipline
PL_Predictor's features/rolling_form.py uses for goals scored/conceded.
