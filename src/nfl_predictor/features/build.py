    `div_game` is a real modelled feature (`FEATURE_COLUMNS`) and training fills it
    from the schedule, where it toggles for roughly a third of games. It used to be
    hardcoded to 0 at serving time, so the model was fitted with the covariate
    varying and served with it permanently constant -- the fitted coefficient was
    dead weight at inference.

    Extracted from `build_features_for_game` so the season-scoping rule can be
    tested without reconstructing a full valid games frame.

    Two rules, both of which the first version of this lookup got wrong:

    - **Scope to the most recent season.** `routes._load_game_history`
      concatenates eight completed seasons and `schedules.fetch_schedules` sorts
      `["season", "week", "gameday"]` -- oldest first -- so the first home/away
      pair on record is from the *earliest* season available. Demonstrated: a frame
      where 2019's BUF-MIA was divisional and 2021's and 2026's were not served
      `div_game = 1` for a 2026 game whose true value is 0.
    - **Take the latest matchup inside that season**, not the first, since a
      division's two meetings are both in the frame.

    Falls back to 0 for any frame without the column, which is also the training
    default, so a games frame that never carried `div_game` still serves.
