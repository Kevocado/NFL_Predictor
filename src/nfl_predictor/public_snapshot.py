"""public_snapshot.py — precomputes games/predictions/player-props for a
window of weeks so the public deployment never has to run this project's
live feature-building pipeline (schedule/player-stat fetch, feature build,
model predict, the CFBD-style roster fallback) on an actual request.

Run this locally, or from .github/workflows/refresh-public-snapshot.yml:

    python -m nfl_predictor.public_snapshot

Then commit + push data/public_snapshot.json -- the running deployment
picks it up within PUBLIC_SNAPSHOT_POLL_SECONDS via
api/routes.py::refresh_public_snapshot_from_remote, no redeploy needed.
See config.py's PUBLIC_SNAPSHOT_PATH for the rest of that mechanism.
